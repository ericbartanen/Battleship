# Description: Battleship Game with 2 players on a 10x10 grid.

class ShipGame:
	"""
	Represents the two-player Ship Game (similar to Battleship). This game is played on a 10x10	grid. Players can
	create as many ships as they like as long as they are at least 2 squares long and entirely within the bounds
	of the grid. Ships can be placed in any order. However, the game begins with firing torpedoes and player one
	goes first, then players alternate game play. Players fire torpedoes attempting to sink their opponents ships.
	The winner is declared once all of a playerâ€™s ships are sunk.
